## Building
To build and run this program, navigate to the correct directory. Make a new 'build' directory, cmake in previous directory, then make in the build directory. Then run the program with the shader file names and object file name as command line arguments.

Example:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Solar
```
